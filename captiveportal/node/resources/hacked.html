  <h1>Uh oh!</h1>
  <p>You fell for it. You've sent your Google credentials through an insecure connection.</p>
  <p><strong>Your credentials</strong>:</p>
  <p><strong>Username</strong>: [PLACEHOLDER_USERNAME]</p>
  <p><strong>Password</strong>: [PLACEHOLDER_PASSWORD]</p>
  <p>Don't panic! I'm an ethical hacker. This server does not collect any data on its connections. Your credentials were not logged/saved anywhere.</p>
  <p>The next time that your browser warns you about an insecure connection, please respect it. Make sure to pay attention to any icons and indicators on your browser's UI; the internet is a dangerous place, and any modern browser is well-equipped to keep you protected, as long as you pay attention to its indicators.</p>
  <p>Again, I promise you that your credentials are not saved anywhere. They were simply forwarded back as a part of this HTML page. However, if you feel paranoid, feel free to change your password (you've learned the rather easy way).</p>
  <p>Also, don't use this network anymore; as you can clearly see, it's been compromised.</p>
  <p>- Your friendly local hacker</p>
